	/**
	 * The actual order that leveling up is supposed to go in:
	 * 1. Choose Class to advance in (We're assuming this is not going to change for this program)
	 * 2. Adjust Base Attack Bonus (Since 1 does not change, this does not deviate either)
	 * 3. Adjust Base Save Bonuses (Since 1 does not change, this does not deviate either)
	 * 4. Assign Ability Score Increase (if level % 4 == 0) (This will need to be called every 4th level)
	 * 5. Roll Hit Points for level (This would need to be called at every level instead of calcualted directly)
	 * 6. Calculate and assign skill points (This would need to be called at every level instead of calculated directly)
	 * 7. Assign feat if applicable for level (Not a featuer yet)
	 * 8. Select spells if applicable (Not a feature yet)
	 * 9. Assign Class Features (Not a feature yet)
	 * 
	 * So, based on what we've noted here, our procedure should look something like this:
	 * 1. Set class
	 * 2. Calculate the BAB and Base Saves as if player takes only that class up to selected level
	 * 3. Determine Hit Die based on class
	 * 4. Set the base stats.
	 * 5. Begin the level up procedure 
	 * 	5a. Check if level % 4 is 0; If it is, do the smart_ability_increase, else continue;
	 * 	5b. Roll HD and add (updated) con score to the total_hitpoints
	 * 	5c. Calculate available skill points and add (updated) int modifier to the total_skillpoints
	 * 	5d. Distribute skill points
	 * 6. Proceed as normal.
